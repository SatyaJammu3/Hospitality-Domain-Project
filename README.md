In the dynamic realm of high-end hospitality, AtliQ Grands, a renowned luxury hotel chain, encountered revenue challenges that were impacting its competitive standing. As an ambitious Data Analyst, I took on the task of leveraging data analytics to reshape the fortunes of this esteemed 5-star hotel chain in India.

Let‚Äôs delve into some key highlights about AtliQ Grands:

‚û°Ô∏è A celebrated five-star hotel chain, AtliQ Grands has a significant presence in four major Indian cities.

‚û°Ô∏è In these metropolitan areas, AtliQ Grands operates seven unique establishments, each strategically located to serve a diverse range of guests.

‚û°Ô∏è The hotel chain offers four categories of rooms ‚Äì Elite, Premium, Presidential, and Standard ‚Äì catering to varied guest preferences and ensuring a customized stay.

‚û°Ô∏è AtliQ Grands ensures easy booking through six well-known reservation platforms, enhancing the convenience for its guests.

**Project Overview:** My objective was crystal clear ‚Äì to use data-driven insights to guide smarter strategic decisions at AtliQ Grands. This involved analyzing several key datasets:

- **dim_date:** This dataset provided date-specific details like calendar dates, week numbers, and day types (weekdays and weekends), crucial for studying booking patterns over time.

- **dim_hotels:** This dataset gave us important information about each property, such as their IDs, names, categories, and locations, vital for understanding the dynamics of each hotel in the chain.

- **dim_rooms:** This dataset offered insights into room types, helping us analyze the popularity and profitability of different room categories.

- **fact_aggregated_bookings:** This core dataset included information on bookings, property IDs, check-in dates, room types, and capacities, instrumental for calculating key metrics like booking rates and occupancy.

**Key Findings:**

‚ñ∂ Total Earnings: An impressive 1.71 billion rupees in revenue. üí∞

‚ñ∂ Revenue Leader by City: Mumbai, accounting for 40% of the overall revenue.

‚ñ∂ City with Highest Ratings: Delhi, with an average rating of 3.8.

‚ñ∂ Luxury vs. Business Segment: The Luxury category led the way, generating 1053 million rupees.

‚ñ∂ Standout Property: AtliQ Exotica, earning a notable 320 million rupees in revenue.

‚ñ∂ Most Popular Room Type: Elite rooms, as identified through the dim_rooms dataset.

‚ñ∂ Leading Booking Platform: Makeyourtrip, a major contributor to revenue.

‚ñ∂ Top-Performing Hotels: AtliQ Exotica led with 320 million rupees, followed by AtliQ Seasons at 66 million rupees, as identified in the dim_hotels dataset.

‚ñ∂ ADR Insights: AtliQ Seasons led with an ADR of 16.6k, with AtliQ Blu at 11.9k.

These insights are not mere figures; they represent a strategic blueprint for rejuvenating AtliQ Grands‚Äô revenue approach. With Mumbai as a revenue bastion and Delhi as a highly-rated city, focused marketing strategies are advisable. The preference for Elite rooms suggests potential for specialized promotional campaigns, while Makeyourtrip‚Äôs dominance indicates a promising partnership opportunity.

The exceptional performance of AtliQ Exotica sets a benchmark for other properties, with strategies inferred from the fact_aggregated_bookings dataset. Additionally, optimizing the ADR at AtliQ Blu could further escalate revenue.

In summary, data analytics has opened a plethora of opportunities for AtliQ Grands. By capitalizing on these insights, the hotel chain is well-poised to reclaim its market dominance and continue leading in the luxury and business hotel sector.

This project is more than just an assignment; it's a burgeoning success story, fueled by data-driven innovation and strategic foresight.
